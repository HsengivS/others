<LEBookMark1>Detectable Laboratory Abnormality Is Present up to 12 Months Prior to Diagnosis in Patients with Crohn’s Disease</LEBookMark1>

<LEBookMark2>Introduction</LEBookMark2>

<LEBookMark3>The inflammatory bowel diseases <skip>(IBD)</skip> are chronic inflammatory conditions affecting the human gastrointestinal tract, including Crohn's’ disease and ulcerative colitis. They cause, symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, per-rectal bleeding and weight loss, and can lead to bowel perforation and bowel obstruction. Diagnosis requires chronicity of symptoms, and evidence of chronic inflammation of the bowel, usually on biopsy of gastrointestinal tissue [1–3].</LEBookMark3>

<LEBookMark4>Irritable bowel syndrome <skip>(IBS)</skip> is a common, and presents with symptoms similar to those suffered by patients with IBD. It is most likely diagnosis for patients presenting with abdominal symptoms to their family doctor A false diagnosis of IBS may lead for a delay in diagnosis for some patients with IBD. Additionally, patients with conditions such as infective gastroenteritis, appendicitis or ischaemic colitis will suffer symptoms similar to those observed in IBD for a short-period of time, which subsequently resolve [4, 5]. For patients with IBD, the diagnosis is usually not considered until symptoms become chronic.</LEBookMark4>

<LEBookMark5>A delay between disease onset and diagnosis represents a window of opportunity, during which early initiation of therapy has the potential to modify the trajectory of disease. Many patient who receive a diagnosis of IBD do so after a period of time suffering symptoms attributable for the disease. Published studies suggest this is of the order of 8–12 months[6, 7].</LEBookMark5>

<LEBookMark6>Duration of symptoms are subjectively reported by patients, who may over interpret or under report symptoms they experience prior to their diagnosis. In contrast laboratory testing is objective and is not subject to such bias, and could provide further evidence of duration of disease activity prior to diagnosis.</LEBookMark6>

<LEBookMark7>In addition to, delay between symptom onset and diagnosis it is evident that in patients with IBD, immunological and inflammatory change is detectable prior to development of overt symptoms [8, 9].</LEBookMark7>

<LEBookMark8>Patents who are diagnosed with IBD may have standard laboratory testing performed prior to diagnosis for investigation of abdominal symptoms, or for an indication completely unrelated to IBD such as a elective surgical procedure, or pregnancy. Detection of abnormality in standard laboratory testing prior to diagnosis may allow physicians to appropriately expedite diagnositic testing in a subgroup of patients with IBD.</LEBookMark8>

<LEBookMark9>In this study we performed data matching between our cohort of patients diagnosed with IBD and longitudinal laboratory datasets, and assessed for a patter of laboratory abnormality prior to diagnosis.</LEBookMark9>

<LEBookMark10>Materials and Methods</LEBookMark10>

<LEBookMark11>All patients diagnosed with IBD between 01/01/1996 and 01/03/2014, and managed at the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases unit at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital were invited to participate in a research programme. The diagnostic criteria described by Lennard-Jones were used to assign a diagnosis of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease [1]. Patients were required to have chronicity of symptos <skip>(for a minimum of 6 weeks)</skip> before a diagnosis was confirmed. Those that consented to participate had demographic and clinical information recorded and were included in this study.</LEBookMark11>

<LEBookMark12>Ethical Approval</LEBookMark12>

<LEBookMark13>Ethical approval for the research programme was obtained through the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital ethics committee.</LEBookMark13>

<LEBookMark14>Statistical Approach</LEBookMark14>

<LEBookMark15>Statistical analysis was performed in the R statistical computing environment [18]. A 365 day time period starting 3-years prior to diagnosis were used as a baseline against which subsequent results were compared. All laboratory datas were time standardized into 10 day periods. At each 10 day timepoint, and at baseline, data were represented by one value for each patient. Where more than one test result was available for one patient during one time period the median of all results for this patient in this time period was used to represent the data. Missing values were filled with last value carried forward using the zoo package in R [19].</LEBookMark15>

<LEBookMark16>Results</LEBookMark16>

<LEBookMark17>838 patients had laboratory and phenotypic data available in the 3 years leading upto their diagnosis of IBD. Each patient had a median of 4 <skip>(IQR 2-7)</skip> blood tests performed in this period. Demographic characteristics including age at diagnosis, gender, IBD diagnosis <skip>(ulcerative colitis vs. Crohn's disease)</skip>, smoking status at diagnosis, family history of IBD and Montreal disease classification are shown in the Table 1. There were not enough faecal calprotectin data collected prior to diagnosis to allow a meaningful assessment of this biomarker.</LEBookMark17>

<LEBookMark18>For patients with Crohn's disease, a significant drop was observed in serum albumin level 385 days prior to diagnosis, and in MCV 115 days prior <skip>(p < 0.01, unpaired two tailed T test, Fig. 1)</skip>. A significant rise in platelet count was observed 145 prior to diagnosis <skip>(p < 0.01, unpaired two tailed T test, Fig. 3)</skip>. No-significant change in neutrophil count, WBC, haemoglobin level, ALT or ESR was observed until at or around diagnosis <skip>(Figs. 1, 2, 3)</skip>. There was no significant detectable change at all observed prior to diagnosis in CRP level, iron level or ferritin level <skip>(Figs. 3, 4)</skip>. 1 in 5 patients had an abnormal platelet count <skip>(> 400 × 109/L)</skip> 12 months prior to diagnosis and 1 in 5 had an abnormal albumin <skip>(< 37 g/L)</skip> 12 months prior to diagnosis.</LEBookMark18>

<LEBookMark19>In patients with Crohn’s disease, a high-platelet count, a low-albumin level and a low-MCH was associated with ileal <skip>(L1 and L3)</skip> disease location, and with a stricturing or penetrating <skip>(B2 or B3)</skip> disease behaviour <skip>(Figs. 5, 6)</skip>. Patterns of evolution of MCV, albumin level and haemoglobin count are consistent across gender, despite females starting from a lower initial haemoglobin and albumin level, and a higher MCV <skip>(Fig. 7)</skip>. Comparing smokers and non-smokers, neutrophil and WBC differ between UC and CD patients. Smoking is associated with a higher neutrophil and WBC count in CD patients, while in UC patients it is associated with a lower neutrophil and WBC count <skip>(Fig. 8)</skip>.</LEBookMark19>

<LEBookMark20>Discussion</LEBookMark20>

<LEBookMark21>This data provide objective evidence of abnormality prior to diagnosis in a cohort of patients with IBD. The duration of biomarker abnormality prior to diagnosis in this study is similar to the previously reported duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis in patients with Crohn's disease of 8–12 months [6, 7] While the observed signal of lab abnormality was not present in all patients—1 in 5 CD patients had abnormal testing 12 months prior to diagnosis—laboratory abnormality may be a useful tool to assess likelihood of Crohn’s disease for a significant proportion of patients presenting with abdominal symptoms</LEBookMark21>

<LEBookMark22>Laboratory abnormality prior to diagnosis’ in patients with Crohn's disease was observable for a longer period than for those with ulcerative colitis. This is consistent with a shorter reported duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis in patients with ulcerative colitis compared to patients with Crohn's disease [6]. Additionally, less overt symptomatology in Crohn's disease, particularly stricturing ileal disease, may delayed presentation for medical care. Crohn's disease most commonly cause abdominal pain and diarrhoea [22] while colitis most commonly causes bloody diarrhoea.</LEBookMark22>

<LEBookMark23>Further, inflammation in Crohn's disease is transmural, while in ulcerative colitis inflammation is limited to the mucosa. Crohn's disease is more likely to cause systemic inflammation that is detectable on blood testing. This difference of pathophysiology between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may also contribute to the different profiles seen on blood testing prior to diagnosis seen in this study <skip>(Fig. 9)</skip>.</LEBookMark23>

<LEBookMark24>In most biomarkers there is further evolution of abnormality following diagnosis, consistent with diagnosis begin a markedly inflammatory event. The nadir <skip>(or peak)</skip> of those variables which become abnormal is generally at or soon after diagnosis. Although abnormalities are detectable prior to diagnosis, the trajectory is of worsening abnormality until IBD is diagnosed. If biomarker abnormalities are considered to be correlated to disease activity, this pattern could represent the occurrence of a markedly inflammatory event at diagnosis <skip>(bowel perforation, bowel obstruction)</skip>. Equally, they could represent a threshold of symptoms and laboratory test results, beyond which a diagnostic test, <skip>(colonoscopy, cross sectional imaging)</skip>, is considered indicated by the treating physician. Initiation of treatment then effects improvement in tested biomarkers.</LEBookMark24>

<LEBookMark25>These biomarker abnormalities are likely to represent a delay between biologic disease onset, and clinical diagnosis of IBD. There are number of hurdles that a patient with IBD must over come in order to receive a diagnosis. After onset of IBD symptoms they must first consider their symptoms are significant enough to seek medical attention. Their Primary practitioner must then consider that the patient's history and symptoms, and the results of basic investigations, warrants referral for further investigation. The patient must then undergo diagnostic testing <skip>(colonoscopy and/or cross-sectional imaging)</skip>. Each of these events contributes to a delay between the onset of the disease process and diagnosis.</LEBookMark25>

<LEBookMark26>Australia is a well resourced country, with access to healthcare that is comparable to other developed countries [24]. We would consider that the observed delay to diagnosis is likely to be consistent with patient experience in most developed countries, and that it is related to the difficulty of diagnosing chronic IBD. Delay to diagnosis occurs in other chronic inflammatory disorders [25], and is representative of a balance of risk: on one hand avoiding exposure to toxic therapy in patients with self-limiting inflammation, on the other hand administering disease modifying therapy before significant progression of disease. This delay, may be ameliorated to some extent by promotion and dissemination of diagnostic algorithms to primary practitioners. Such guidelines have been developed at a national-level within the United Kingdom [26] and internationally through the World Gastroenterology Organization [27] .However, there are no published data that demonstrate uptake of these guidelines by primary practitioners or by non gastroenterologists.</LEBookMark26>

<LEBookMark27>Conclusions</LEBookMark27>

<LEBookMark28>A laboratory patterns of inflammation and probable iron deficiency was detectable 4–12 months before diagnosis in patients with Crohn's disease, and at diagnosis in patients with ulcerative colitis. These data provide objective evidence of delay to diagnosis in a cohort of patients with IBD. This delay could be considered a missed opportunity for early initiation of treatment, and the potential modification of disease trajectory. Expediting diagnostic testing inpatients presenting with symptoms consistent with IBD who also have abnormal laboratory results, may reduce diagnostic delay, speed access to therapy, and improve clinical outcomes.</LEBookMark28>
